# Basic-3D-Engine:

It's a school project I had to do by the end of 2017. We did not have the freedom to use a mathematical library and we had to make one. The goal of this project was to create a 3D engine.

# How to Run:

You will find .exe in the /ProjetMoteur/Exec/ (Linux have one too)
to freely use the app, launch it by a command line in a console, it's the only way to have access to the shape construction (more information in the readme associate to the /ProjetMoteur/Exec/ )

# Documentation:

You can find a Doxygen documentation there : /Doc/html/

# Demo:

coming soon
