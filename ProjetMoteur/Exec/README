`'F':
switch from 'full shape' to 'wire'.

'P':
switch from perspective projection to orthographic projection.

'C':
to create a new shape:
choice between :
CUBE - PRISM - CYLINDER - PLANE - TRIANGLE - SPHERE - OTHER
with OTHER to load a complex surface from an .obj file 
All objects are centered in 0 0 0 at creation (except TRIANGLE) and can be moved with the mouse.
During the creation process, the scene is blocked until the creation is finalized.
